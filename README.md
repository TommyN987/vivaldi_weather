# Vivaldi's Weather

## A JavaScript Application

[Live Version](https://tommyn987.github.io/vivaldi_weather/)

Vivaldi's Weather is a fully responsive weather application built with Vanilla JavaScript and Sass (SCSS). It utilizes the Open Weather API for retrieving weather data. By default, the app uses the user's location (via the Geolocation API) to display the appropriate data. If the user blocks access to geolocation, there is no default data. However, with the search functionality, the user can access data for thousands of towns and cities that are within the scope of the Open Weather API.

### Why Vivaldi?

To provide a little artistic flavor to the user experience, the app plays some weather-appropriate background music - specifically a part of Antonio Vivaldi's Four Seasons. The background image also changes dynamically - based on the weather conditions of the searched town.
